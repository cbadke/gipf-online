gipf-online
===========

A clojure based webapp implementing the Gipf project .

Files in resources/public/css and resources/public/javascript are built from Sass and CoffeeScript files using precompile.sh

While these files need to be checked in for Heroku deployment they should not be manually editted and considered artifacts of the build.
